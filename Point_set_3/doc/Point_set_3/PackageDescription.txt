\defgroup PkgPointSet3PointSetProcessing3 Point Set Processing
\ingroup PkgPointSet3

\brief This module offers convenience overloads of functions available in the
\ref PkgPointSetProcessingSummary package. These overloads allow the
user to call point set processing algorithms without having to handle
manually property maps and iterators.

The overloads, available after including
`CGAL/Point_set_3/Point_set_processing_3.h`, all follow the same
pattern based on the original point set processing functions:

- Iterators and property maps of the original functions are replaced
with a single parameter `CGAL::Point_set_3<Point,Vector>`

- The other parameters (and their potential default values) are
following in the same order as the original function.

For a complete documentation of these functions, please refer to the
\ref PkgPointSetProcessing manual.

\defgroup PkgPointSet3IO Input/Output
\ingroup PkgPointSet3

\brief This module offers convenience overloads of input/ouput
functions available in the \ref PkgPointSetProcessingSummary package.
These overloads, available after including `CGAL/Point_set_3/IO.h`,
allow the user to call point set processing algorithms without having
to handle manually property maps and iterators.

Input functions instanciate all the necessary property maps:

- if found in the input, normal vectors are stored in the usual
`CGAL::Point_set_3` property `normal` with template type `Vector`

- for PLY and LAS input, other properties are stored as properties in
the `CGAL::Point_set_3` class with the name and type given by the PLY
header or by the LAS standard.

For a complete documentation of these functions, please refer to the
\ref PkgPointSetProcessing manual.
